<p>For the first review I presented off a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ_ppBms=/?share_link_id=625409934428" target="_blank">Miro board</a>, and for the second review off of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qeAWn2ajFOwUr0qWTJZkLGqc_kzgKDdkkwGUueV9Qc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> page I experimented with.</p>
        <p>In the final presentation, I put different projects I'd been working on over the course of the semester together into a small exhibit / performance lecture, layering transparencies on the overhead projector as I talked.</p>
