        <p>This project engages with scientific reports on the geology and soil of Gaza, archival maps created by the British Survey of Palestine, samples of plants sprayed by the IDF’s herbicides, archival videos, Geomolg—the national geographic information system of Palestine, reports by Forensic Architecture, and Landsat satellite data. Conceptually, I draw upon the works of scholars who understand land in Palestine volumetrically and densely, including Nadia Abu El Haj and Eyal Weizman, along with photographic/satellite image theory, and methods theorized through groups in the <a href="https://investigative-commons.org/">Investigative Commons</a>, including INTERPRT and Forensic Architecture. 
</p>
<p>I am viewing the plants planted in the agricultural fields along the Gaza border as sensors; their biological existences, in their many iterations, sense the evolving status of the border, from its nonexistence to the plow that drove through the earth to mark the border in 1951, to the increasing depth of the border wall itself (in some places deep into the ground to block tunnels, to the increasing width of the border through the implementation of no go and risk zones by Israel, to the limiting of plant heights to maintain military lines of sight into the strip. Tracing what these sensors are registering involves historical research and computational visualization processes, including georeferencing to see where olive and citrus groves used to be, to NDVI analysis, to creative forms of visualizing these narratives.
