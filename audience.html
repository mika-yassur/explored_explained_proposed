          I plan to hold the first (and only planned) iteration of this exhibit in a to-be-determined
          space in New York City. By choosing to present my work in an exhibit, it makes my work very
          much for the immediate community—GSAPP and people I plan to invite. Hopefully I can also
          translate a part of this project (the written component, images, and digital elements of
          the exhibit) online so that they can be spread more widely.

          Creating this project for an even wider public could look like:

          I also consider the web archive I am putting together to be a step in this direction. I need
          to consider what text or explanatory material I will supplement this reference with to make
          it usable for others.
