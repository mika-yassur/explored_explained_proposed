  I plan to hold the first (and only planned) iteration of this exhibit in a to-be-determined
  space in New York City. By choosing to present my work in an exhibit, it makes my work very

  translate a part of this project (the written component, images, and digital elements of
  the exhibit) online so that they can be spread more widely.

  I also consider the web archive I am putting together to be a step in this direction. I need
  to consider what text or explanatory material I will supplement this reference with to make
  it usable for others.
