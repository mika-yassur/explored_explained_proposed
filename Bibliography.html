      </p>

      <p class="commentary">
        These two texts articulate territory as volumetric and spatial, as opposed to flat or maplike.
        Weizman’s text in particular recounts elements of Israeli colonization through this lens,
        helping me understand this colonial history through a spatial and architectural perspective.

      </p>

      <p class="commentary">
        This text explicates the concept of “hollow land” in relation to archaeology and history,
        which I plan to expand on this coming semester.
      </p>

        Srouji, Dima. “Depth Unknown: Archaeology of Resistance.”
        <em>The Architectural Review.</em> September 3, 2024.
      </p>

      <p class="commentary">
        This text also addresses the archaeological perspective in Palestine, this time through
        a collaged video and installation piece. Srouji’s artistic methods are deeply inspiring to me.

      </p>

      <p class="commentary">
        This book examines the relationship between media and plants, including remote sensing and
        thinking through images as surfaces, all of which I want to develop an essay around this
        coming semester.

      <p class="commentary">
        This article helped me think through ideas of future and prediction attached to algorithmic
        models in warfare; what type of future are these systems instantiating?

      <p class="commentary">
        This collection of texts, artworks, and images by various authors is a huge inspiration for
        my project, broadening my concepts of ecology, resistance, and modes of representation.

      <p class="commentary">
        This report details some of the methods Forensic Architecture uses, presenting their
        conclusions as maps and diagrams in ways that I can also integrate into my own work.
